I am a Fall 2021 MS CS student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am passionately curious about many things including Data science, Machine Learning, AI, and futuristic tech. Besides tech, I am curious to learn anything and everything. I believe that I will change the world slowly but surely.

## Facts about me:
:information_desk_person: pronouns: she/her

:key: Skills: Data analytics, Data analysis and visualization, Machine Learning, Web development, Python programming, C programming, Presentation skills, Creativity, Team management, Analytical thinking, Content creation, et cetera.

:dart: Learning: Virtual Reality. But curious to learn anything and everything.

:pencil: I write articles on both tech and non-technical topics. You can see them on [Medium](https://srivishiv15.medium.com/) as well as [Hashnode](https://srivi4ever.hashnode.dev/)

:books: I love reading self-help and fiction books. This simply explains me: "I live in two worlds. One is a world of books" - Rory Gilmore.

:black_nib: I love writing. I write fictions and poetries.

:notes: I am a Melophile. I also sing.

:clapper: Besides tech, reading books, and singing, I also watch series, and animes during my free time.

:microphone: I explored the world of podcasts for a little time by running my own podcast show named "Into the mind of an introvert". You can find the link to various podcast platforms to listen to me [here](https://anchor.fm/sincerelysrivi).

:purple_heart: Spreading positive vibes is my motive.

Remember,

> You become what you think.
